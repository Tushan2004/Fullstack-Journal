# Journal System – Full-Stack Medical Records App

University project built in a small agile team.

## What it does
- Users can register as **doctor**, **patient** or **staff**
- Doctors can create diagnoses and manage patient journal entries
- Patients can view their information and communicate with doctors/staff
- All roles can send messages to each other inside the system

## Tech stack
- Backend: Java/C# microservices with REST APIs
- Frontend: React with HTML/CSS
- Database: SQL
- Other: Docker + basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Focus
The goal of the project was to:
- Practice full-stack development with a realistic domain
- Work with authentication/roles and permissions
- Handle logging, error handling and data consistency
- Run the system in containers and automate build/tests
